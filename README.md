Drivy Backend Challenge - Antoine Quellier

Hello Drivy Team! This is my backend challenge for a fullstack enginer position in Paris.

I've spent one day on it and I've tried to build it as maintainable and scalable as possible.

Running `$ ruby main.rb` from each level folder launches the process. The `drivy.rb` file uses the `data/input.json` to create instances of the models present in the `models` folder. Running `rake` from each level folder will launch rubocop to check for style offenses and rspec to run basic tests.

The data is then saved in `data/output.json`.

Thank you for taking the time to read this,
Hope to hear from you soon :)
